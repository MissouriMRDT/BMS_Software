DONE: Name types for rovecomm data
Need to test: Create and test ADC_MAX for current, every single cell volts, and pack volts
	consider adjusting ADC_MIN to reduce the size of the window measured. Make the lowest possible value I expect the new ADC_MIN
DONE: on pin #defines add "_PIN"
DONE: in getmaincurrent dont define adc_reading by itself, analogread inside the map functions
DONE: could rewrite getoutvoltage to return voltage value instead of it passing by reference
DONE: instead of single debounce, count number of times overcurrent or undervoltage happens and react by turning off rover after a number of loops go bywith overcurrent
DONE: change event to error; make it uint8_t; consider breaking it up into more dataids to simplify code; 
If voltage does read as zero, send a different number than 1 which would tell red that a wire was broken, not that the cell is actually low
DONE: for variables like, "num_overcurrent", declare those as static int blah in the functions.cpp at top before all the functions. Then num_overcurrent wouldn't need to be an argument in the function, so take it out.
DONE: change recheck_delay to be shorter (10s)
DONE: Add rovecomm_delays before turning off rover to allow comms to get to basestation
DONE: use else if on setestop
notify functions wont work so replace with tone(). Use serial monitor for unit tests
