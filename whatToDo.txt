*Get a list of variable needed and define these variables in the header file
(sw_ind, sw_err_ind, V_out_ind, Fans_ind, temp_sense(analog signal in), v_out_sense, 
buzzer_control,pack_i_sense, cell_senses, fan_control, LCD_tx, logic_switch,
logic_power_sense,pack_gate)*

Need a base code (LT1910 needs to be set to "low" on output(?), ESTOP needs to be coded)

Do code for cell_voltages, then current, then temp (all need to be mapped) [Look @ tiva pins to find variables]

LCD screen code

Buzzer @ end (not important)

Do serial prints first and @ very end link to rovecomm (serial print output --> rovecomm language)

Write commands for:
SW_ESTOP
ERROR STATEMENTS
